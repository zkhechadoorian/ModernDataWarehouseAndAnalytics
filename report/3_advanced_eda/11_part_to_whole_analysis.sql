Part-to-Whole Analysis (PostgreSQL)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To compare performance or metrics across dimensions or time periods.
    - To evaluate differences between categories.
    - Useful for A/B testing or regional comparisons.

SQL Functions Used:
    - SUM(), AVG(): Aggregates values for comparison.
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER() for total calculations.
