Data Segmentation Analysis (PostgreSQL)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To group data into meaningful categories for targeted insights.
    - For customer segmentation, product categorization, or regional analysis.

SQL Functions Used:
    - CASE: Defines custom segmentation logic.
    - GROUP BY: Groups data into segments.
