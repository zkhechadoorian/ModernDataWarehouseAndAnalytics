Product Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To analyze product sales performance year over year.
    - To compare current year sales to the product's average sales and the 
      previous year's sales.
    - To identify trends and growth patterns.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.
