CREATE DATABASE & SCHEMAS
================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates a new database named 'datawarehouse' after checking if it already exists.
    First, it terminates active connections if the database is active, then it is dropped and recreated.
    Additionally, the script sets up three schemas within the database: 'bronze', 'silver', and 'gold'.

WARNING:
    Running this script will drop the entire 'datawarehouse' database if it exists.
    All data in the database will be permanently deleted. Proceed with caution
    and ensure you have proper backups before running this script.

How to use:
    Before running this script, make sure to update the project_dir in config.sql
    to match your environment.
